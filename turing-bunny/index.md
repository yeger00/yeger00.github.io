## The rules
<img style="float: right;" src="turing-bunny-board.png">
You goal is to help the bunny get the carrot. The bunny has a changing color magic ball. There is a wheel with colors on it to visualize the colors of the ball. At the beginning of the game the color of the ball is green.

The board contains tiles and colorful arrows between them. At the beginning of the game the tiles are empty. You need to place "action cards" on them. There are two types action cards:

Change color to left

Change color to right
After you placed action cards on all the tiles you start to move the bunny
When you get to a tile, you need to perform the action
Then you need to move the bunny according to the arrows:
1. If the color of the ball match to the color of one of the arrows you need to follow this arrow
2. If it doesn't match, and there is a black arrow you need to follow it
3. If there is no arrow you can follow, you are stuck and need to re-try

When you get to the carrot - YOU WIN!

## About The Game
The game is designed to enable the player to write "code" and then mimic the behavior of a CPU without touching the computer, and while still having fun. Each "action card" represnts one [opcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode), the arrows are [conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)) (colored arrow is an `if` and black arrow is the `else`), the entire board is the program, and the bunny is the [instruction pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/instruction_pointer).
